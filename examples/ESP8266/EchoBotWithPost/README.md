#ESP8266 - Echo Bot with post

This is a basic example of how to use sendPostMessage functionality of ESP8266TelegramBOT.

sendPostMessage allows the more advanced options of the Telegram Api to be used (see CustomKeyboard example for how to use keyboards).

The application will echo an message it received back to the user.

NOTE: You will need to enter your SSID, password and bot Token for the example to work.
